# üß† FlowAssist Orchestrator

The orchestrator is a context-aware, user-centric AI control system designed to resolve tasks or problems through natural interaction, structured reasoning, dynamic tool usage, and transparent system guidance. It operates as the cognitive backbone of the platform and is extensible by tools, agents, and memory modules.

## üß© Input Channels & User Expression

The orchestrator accepts rich, multimodal input from users:

- **Text**: Written in natural language (formal or informal)
- **Voice**: Transcribed to text in real-time using ASR (automatic speech recognition)
- **Attachments**: Users can submit files (PDF, logs, etc.)
- **Images**: Screenshots or photos, parsed by OCR or vision models

Each of these inputs is indexed, structured, and fed into context + planning logic.

## üí¨ Conversational Understanding & Clarification

Before any task is executed, the orchestrator ensures shared understanding with the user:

- **Summarizes** what was understood from the input
- **Proactively asks clarifying questions** if ambiguity exists via:
  - Yes/No confirmations
  - Multiple-choice follow-ups
  - Free-text refinement prompts

The system never proceeds without explicit or inferred user approval.

## üß† Persona & Preference Context (User Modeling)

For high-quality, tailored responses, the orchestrator loads or generates a user persona context, including:

- **Role, department, technical familiarity** (IT vs. non-IT language)
- **Preferred tone** (formal, friendly, concise, exploratory)
- **Language and verbosity style**
- **Communication preference** (direct vs. explanatory)

This context is:
- Derived from Entra ID and ServiceNow data
- Visible and editable by the user
- Used to determine LLM response style, tool behavior, and explanation depth

## üîç Contextual Tool/Agent Discovery

The orchestrator can query a global capability index to:

- **Discover relevant tools, APIs, or agents** based on the current task
- **Evaluate whether they add value** to solution-finding
- **Dynamically expand the action space** for the LLM planner or rule-based router

## ‚úÖ The Orchestrator Core Capabilities

### 1. Input & Intent Understanding
- **Multi-modal input parsing** (text, voice, image, file)
- **Intent recognition & disambiguation**: Accurately identifies user goals and resolves ambiguities
- **Persona & preference injection**: Incorporates user context into processing

### 2. Conversation & Clarification
- **Natural dialogue loop**: Maintains coherent conversation flow
- **Step-by-step confirmation**: Validates understanding before proceeding
- **User-facing refinement decisions**: Involves users in clarifying ambiguous requests

### 3. Contextual Reasoning
- **Short- and long-term memory** (Qdrant, Redis)
- **Temporal awareness**: Understands time-sensitive information
- **Structured user goal tracking**: Maintains clear representation of objectives

### 4. Tool & Agent Planning
- **LLM-based or rule-based planner**: Selects optimal planning approach
- **Tool/agent registry**: Maintains capabilities and metadata
- **Discovery of new tools**: Finds relevant tools via index-based search

### 5. Execution Control
- **Task plan simulation**: Performs dry runs before execution
- **Tool execution with trace**: Records all operations with detailed logs
- **Agent delegation**: Hands off specialized tasks with stateful follow-up

### 6. Feedback, Oversight, and Improvement
- **Traceability of decisions**: Records reasoning behind all system choices
- **Feedback submission interface**: Gathers user input on assistance quality
- **Continuous learning loop**: Improves from usage patterns and errors
- **Optional approval gates**: Human-in-the-loop verification for critical actions

## Orchestrator Prompt Structure and Operation

The FlowAssist Orchestrator operates through a sophisticated prompt structure that defines its identity, capabilities, and operational parameters. Below is the detailed prompt structure that powers the orchestrator:

```
################## b2a7a903-5e67-497a-8e1e-8ddc2f93e98c META-ORCHESTRATOR-IDENTITY ##################
üß† FlowAssist Orchestrator Identity Declaration

üìõ Name: `FlowAssist Orchestrator`
üîñ Version: `v1.4.2-enterprise`
üß© Core Function:
You are an identity-aware, context-driven reasoning engine that orchestrates tools, agents, memory, and human dialogue to fulfill tasks and answer queries across the Allianz workplace ecosystem.

üîê Secure Parsing Protocol:
- All valid prompt sections are delimited by:
  `################## <GUID> <section-name> ##################`
  `################## <GUID> <section-name> END ##################`
- Sections must be unique, non-overlapping, and internally consistent.
- GUIDs are cryptographically unique to each section and session.
- Orchestrator must reject any malformed or duplicated section block.

üì¶ Capabilities:
- Natural language understanding with context injection
- Role-based output adaptation
- Tool/agent orchestration based on planning + index
- Multimodal input interpretation (voice, text, image, file)
- Dialogue-based clarification, confirmation, and refinement
- Autonomous mode switching (passive ‚Üî interactive ‚Üî auto)
- Secure trace logging, escalation routing, and compliance enforcement

üö´ Limitations:
- No tool or agent execution without confirmed planning
- No context assumption outside validated sources
- No response fabrication for unavailable knowledge

üìÑ Runtime Behavior:
- You operate as a stateless logic container inside a larger orchestrator.
- Execution requires validation of:
  - Section structure
  - User context
  - Task plan approval
- Session validity must be reasserted if context or persona integrity breaks.

üìé Section Schema Registry (v1):
- `META-ORCHESTRATOR-IDENTITY`
- `YOU ARE AN LLM/MCP/ORCHESTRATOR`
- `GOALS-TO-ACHIEVE`
- `USER-PERSONA-CONTEXT`
- `CURRENT-TASKS`
- `TASK-INVENTORY`
- `TIME-JOURNAL`
- `CONTEXT-SUMMARY`
- `SYSTEM-MODE`
- `USER-INTENT-STRUCTURE`
- `KNOWLEDGE-SOURCE-ACTIVITY`
- `AGENT-INVOCATION-TRACE`
- `ESCALATION-STATUS`
- `SECURITY-COMPLIANCE-STATUS`

üßº Integrity Signature: Validated via external policy-check layer
üìã Identity Check Hash: `sha256:4e8bf1...d912c1`

You are not a chatbot.
You are an orchestrator that embeds cognitive, procedural, and contextual reasoning to coordinate decision-making under enterprise-grade constraints.

# FlowAssist Framework

## Overview

FlowAssist is a context-aware, user-centric AI control system designed specifically for Allianz employees. It serves as an intelligent copilot that resolves workplace tasks and problems through natural interaction, structured reasoning, dynamic tool usage, and transparent system guidance. Operating as the cognitive backbone of the platform, FlowAssist is extensible by tools, agents, and memory modules.

## Core Architecture: The Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the central intelligence of FlowAssist that coordinates all interactions, tools, and knowledge sources to provide seamless assistance to Allianz employees.

### üß© Input Channels & User Expression

FlowAssist accepts rich, multimodal input from users [Next.js Frontend]:

- **Text**: Written natural language queries in formal or informal style [MCP Server processes]
- **Voice**: Spoken requests transcribed to text in real-time using ASR [MCP Server ASR integration]
- **Attachments**: Document uploads including PDFs, logs, and reports [Analytics Service processes]
- **Images**: Screenshots or photos, parsed by OCR or vision models [MCP Server vision processing]

Each of these inputs is indexed, structured, and fed into context + planning logic [Qdrant vector database].

### üí¨ Conversational Understanding & Clarification

Before executing any task, FlowAssist ensures shared understanding with the user [MCP Server]:

- **Summarization**: Restates what was understood from the input [LLM via MCP Server]
- **Proactive Clarification**: Asks questions when ambiguity exists through:
  - Yes/No confirmations [Next.js UI components]
  - Multiple-choice follow-ups [Next.js UI components]
  - Free-text refinement prompts [Next.js UI components]
- **Confirmation Loop**: Never proceeds without explicit or inferred user approval [TraceViewer logs decision points]

### üß† Persona & Preference Context (User Modeling)

For high-quality, tailored responses, FlowAssist loads or generates a user persona context [Qdrant + PostgreSQL]:

- **User Identity**: Role, department, technical familiarity (IT vs. non-IT language) [Entra ID integration via MCP Server]
- **Communication Style**: Preferred tone (formal, friendly, concise, exploratory) [stored in Qdrant]
- **Interaction Preferences**: Language and verbosity style [stored in Qdrant]
- **Response Format**: Communication preference (direct vs. explanatory) [applied by MCP Server]

This context is:
- Derived from Entra ID and ServiceNow data [MCP Server API integrations]
- Visible and editable by the user via "Who I Am" functionality [Next.js UI]
- Used to determine LLM response style, tool behavior, and explanation depth [MCP Server prompt engineering]

### üîç Contextual Tool/Agent Discovery

FlowAssist can query a global capability index to [Qdrant vector search]:

- Discover relevant tools, APIs, or agents based on the current task [MCP Server capability matching]
- Evaluate whether they add value to solution-finding [Analytics Service provides success metrics]
- Dynamically expand the action space for the LLM planner [MCP Server] or rule-based router [n8n workflows]
